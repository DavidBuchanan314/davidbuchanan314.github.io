Monochrome was a game I wrote during the summer of 2014, for the Ludum Dare 48hr game jam:

I ranked 523rd overall, out of a total of 2538 entries, which isn't too bad for babby's first game.

I thought the source for this game was lost forever, but luckily archive.org had archived a copy!

Showing off this game to some companies got me some work experience and a paid internship, so it has a fair amount of sentimental value.

It even got played by someone on YouTube: https://youtu.be/DOSk1bi234E?t=11m57s
